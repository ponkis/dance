### 🚀 Description
This project plays a random dancing GIF on the screen, synchronized with a random music track. The GIF moves around the screen in sync with the BPM of the music, creating a fun visual experience. This Python project uses **Tkinter** for the GUI, **Pillow** for handling GIFs, and **Pygame** to play music.

### 🎵 IMPORTANT (HOW TO ADD SONGS)
For adding songs you MUST add the file name with its extension ex: **909.mp3** to the **BPM.txt** file inside the **bpm** folder, alongside the BPM of the song ex: **127**
*909.mp3 = 127*
